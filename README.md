# When a developer leaves GCIO/VSA

## Assumptions

- The Off-Boarding-Developer (OFD) leaves under good circumstances.
- The Off-Boarding-Developer (OFD) has given a two weeks notice.

## Key Ideas

- Keep the process lightweight
- Wrapping up Current work
- Knowledge transfer
- Seemless transition to new developer
- kicking off new hire process

## The asks

- The replacement developer has been identified
  - A primary replacement and secondary
- Identify all open tickets for the remaining sprint
  - Since two weeks notice will also land in the middle of sprint
  - The OFD should be asked to finish all current tickets in flight
  - The OFD pair programs with the replacement developer all open tickets
  in the sprint. This will affect estimates and velocity.
  - If the OFD is still on the team for part of the next sprint, they should be pairing with the replacement developer.
- The OFD should not take up new tickets
- Expectations should be set with the PMs on the affected velocity with a realistic target date of when the velocity is back up
- Knowledge transfer meeting
  - At least 3x1hr knowledge transfer meetings.
    - One of them focused on transferring to the replacement developer
    - One of them should include the other developers on the team
    - One of them should include the second replacement developer
- Mang't should start the req for hiring new talent
- The OFD should have a going away party/happy hour
